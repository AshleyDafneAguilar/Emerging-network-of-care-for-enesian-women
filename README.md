## Introduction 
The Emerging Network of Enesian Care is a group that started in April 2023 at UNAM, ENES Morelia. Its purpose is to promote a network of care and support for women studying on campus.
This group is made up of teachers and students from different careers on campus. Each of us has different tasks to achieve our goal. 

Here I will upload some of the contributions that I will be developing as a member of this network.
